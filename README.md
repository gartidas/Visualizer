# Visualizer

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Tech stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [ant.design](https://ant.design/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)

## Deployment

[Vercel](https://visualizer-pearl-eight.vercel.app/)

## Assignment

### Requirements
-	The aim of this exercise is to create single web application that will consume data from remote API and will render pulled data in charts
-	Use TypeScript
-	Use next.js framework for building web application
-	Use ant.d library for UI and components on the page
-	Use remote API for data - [Covid-19 data](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide/main-api)
-	Use g2.antv for render charts (any chart types can be used, up to your selection)
-	[OPTIONAL] Use trpc library for backend services and endpoints (use db up to your selection (eg., [Railway](https://railway.app/))

### Design of page (example on the attached screenshot):
-	The page will consist from page header and content area
-	Page header contains only title
-	Content area contains two cards with charts (any chart type is possible) with dummy avatar and dummy button as per picture
-	Above charts, there is a space (a panel) for Page title and dummy buttons (as per design, without any logic behind)
-	[OPTIONAL] Add a heart icon (not on design below!) to cards which allows visitors to select card as a favorite (use trpc for this feature)
